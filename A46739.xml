            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:101539:28"/> is, that most sweet and fragrant <hi>rose of Sharon;</hi> but now thy words and works, O thou prophane Esauite, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable; and though thou hypocrite, and civill honest man make a faire shew without, and professe much, yet are thy very inward parts, reserved imaginations, and closest thoughts most execrable; for they smell altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and stinke of hellish pride, and devillish envy, of filthy lusts, and dunghill covetousnesse; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who will beleeve any of you, that Christ that is in you? you your selves will never beleeve a man, though he should sweare that there are roses in his closet or chest, if when he openeth it, you smell in stead of roses nothing but dung and stinking carrion. Now this is just your case, O ye carnall, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and hypocriticall men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; you may thinke or say Christ is in you, and so consequently, that you have saving faith in Christ; but when you doe but open your mouthes, and disclose your thoughts, unlocking the chests and closets of your hearts, by

               <p>And therefore be convinced of it, all you that are thus abominable, and say no more, that Christ is in you, and that you have saving faith in Christ, seeing you cannot make good what you say, and so consequently neither are nor can be credited or beleeved, what ever ye say and protest of it. <hi>What doth it profit,</hi> my brethren said

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                  </label> I answer, That such as are held to be of the number of Gods people, are of two sorts:</p>
               <p>1. Some are Christians <hi>in shew:</hi> 2. some <hi>in deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former are such as have a form <note place="margin">1.

Now if some of you be such, then never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine or wonder, that you can find no such comfortablenesse in Christ; for you are <hi>dead</hi> like the <hi>widow.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 6.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101539:38"/> which <hi>living in pleasures is dead while she liveth:</hi> and as the * <hi>Angell</hi> of the <note place="margin">

Whereupon it followeth, that all you who love <hi>worse things</hi> then father and mother, sonne or daughter, even base and filthy lusts, and bosome sinnes, more then Christ, must needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy also of Christ himselfe, and so consequently of the comforts of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101539:38"/> Christ, which he never can or will throw away and bestow on such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy hypocrites, and selfe-lovers as you are, who have nothing but a meer forme and shadow of piety without any substance or reality; and therefore my advise and counsell is, that you do labour for the <hi>power and life of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and prefer the love of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, if you desire to finde that comfortablenesse, which is in Christ, or else never look for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for Christians indeed, they <note place="margin">2. Christiās indeed.</note> are of 2. sorts againe: 1. some some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what carelesse, 2. others very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101539:39"/> as to avoid those which are most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enemies to their poore soules; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. of their <hi>duties,</hi> which they doe not so heedfully performe, as they ought, daily <hi>prayer</hi> I meane, and holy <hi>meditations,</hi> and deep <hi>humiliations</hi> for daily sins, and continuall <hi>applyings</hi> of Christ, and the like. Such carelesse Christians were the Corinthians once, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11.</note> as the Apostle implyeth, when he saith; <hi>Behold this selfe same thing that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse it wrought in you,</hi> saith he, to shew that there was none such in them before, and that they did not grieve so before. Now if some of you that cannot find so much comfortable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Christ, as was spoken of here, be such, then never wonder at it: for what comfort can a man take in roses, if he will not take the paines to fetch them, or to apply them; or if he be asleep, how can he smell them, though his chambers were full of roses? well may others that wake, be refreshed with the sent of them, and take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them; but he cannot, so long
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101539:39"/> as he sleepeth: So you that are so carelesse, what comfort can ye take or find in Christ, as long as you will not take the paines, to draw what comfort you can from Christ in that carefull manner, as you ought? yea, are in a manner asleep, in that you be so drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, dead, dull, backward, and carelesse in the doing of your duties; and doe so seldome humble and afflict your soules for your manifold exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, slips, failings, and grievous sins. God comforteth those that <hi>are cast downe,</hi> saith the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 6. but you are not so dejected; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">* <hi>Tamē quod divinas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solationes non habemus, aut rarius senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, nos in culpa sumus; quia cōpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionē cordis non quaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101539:40"/> selves to be Gods people as you may be, doe snatch at such comforts, and apply them, though you doe not feele them, nor indeed are then fit for them; and therefore, I must and will distinguish between you that are carelesse, and those that are carefull, telling you that you for your part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so secure and undejected, you may not, nor must not looke for any sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comforts from Jesus Christ, the <hi>rose of Sharon,</hi> as long as you are, and shall be so carelesly disposed.</p>
               <p>But secondly, as for those that are <note place="margin">2. Carefull ones.</note> carefull among us of every thing, and humble themselves much continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and are dejected, and yet find or feele no comfort for the present, they must not therefore be disheartened, because that he which should comfort them, is farre from them as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; for they may take comfort in this, that either,</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101539:44"/> afflictions; and he sweetens them, though other roses cannot so sweeten the thornes among which they grow: even as that <hi>Tree</hi> did sweeten the <hi>bitter waters of Meriba,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise no body could drinke, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 25. for he assures us, that how ever we speed here and may be entertained in this world, we shall rejoyce in him, and live with him in glory at the last, as you have heard that he will quicken us as a rose, and revive us after death, which is more then a rose can doe: So as that needs we must gaine infinitely more by Christ then we can possibly lose by him.</p>
               <p>And therefore as you take <hi>delight</hi> in a rose, though it be among thorns, so take comfort and joy in Christ, though he be a rose among thornes, that is, surrounded with a number of pricking, piercing, and heart-cutting vexations If one should rob you of all that you possesse, and you were made sure at the same time of an orient Jewell in a sure and a safe place, more worth a thousand times then all that

And therefore as they that wanted corne, went to <hi>Ioseph</hi> in Egypt to got some, so do ye repaire to Christ, beleeving in him, that so you also may rejoyce in him with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable and full of glory: For why will ye, and how can ye live so uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, as ye have lived formerly, being altogether destitute of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirit of promise, whose soule-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing comforts none can truly feele, till he be truly and throughly come home to Christ.</p>

               <p>This one ground well digested, is like to doe you most good; for as I told you formerly, the terrors of the law, breathing out nothing but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and damnation, must first make you afraid, before you will goe to Christ as ye ought: even as a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men will never yeeld to leave the world, and the cares of it, till they see that they must die; and as some others will never beg, being too much asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to doe it, till they see that they must doe it, or strave: so you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yeeld to leave your dearest sins,

And therefore what is it that you should not be willing to doe, and to forgoe, who being prisoners too, must expect every minute to be carried away of the devill, who keeps you in prison, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. into the terrible place of execution, called hell, there to be ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and to be burned, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not by a small, but a great and mighty fire, which the wrath or breath of God, like a streame of brimstone, doth kindle, <hi>Esa.</hi> 30. 33. even for ever and ever, if Christ free you not; nay, suppose a man might escape such a temporall punishment of fire, and save his life, if he would but goe forth out of prison to his King, who can free him, falling downe before him,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101539:66"/> and submitting himselfe unto him to be disposed of by him, doe ye thinke he would not willingly leave his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and even run to the King, and do any thing rather, that the King shall command, then burne. Well, you may escape so, I am sure, and therefore should ye not gladly leave sinne, which is but like a stinking prison, and goe to Christ the King of Kings, who requireth no more but your comming, and the leaving of your sinnes, and humbling of your soules, and a ready submission to be disposed by his holy will: Let Satan then sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest what he will, saying, how can ye forgoe such a darling delight? and how can ye spare such a sweet gaine? and how can ye live without such honour? you may now easily put him off with his owne words, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>All that a man hath will he give for his life;</hi> are not these thine owne words? canst thou deny them Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? thou canst not, thou canst not; and therefore, never trouble us more with these insinuations and

Thus repell Satan, and thus be induced, I pray you, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the day of your visitation, and the most terrible danger you are in, that so you may come home to Christ, and Christ may come to you, which God in mercy grant for his goodnesse, and for his Christs sake.</p>

Well you know that if
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101539:85"/> one doe stirre in a dunghill, and put it abroad, it will stink so much more then it did before, so as that one must needs smell it, and I doubt not but if you shall stirre but a little in this matter, 1. ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacking your hearts; and 2. ripping up your lives, and sifting them exactly, you shall smell more of your odious sinnes then ever you did; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, search your selves, and so labour to come to the sight and sense of all your abominations, that you may get Christ to sweeten you, as roses doe sweeten our houses.</p>
               <p>And here looke back a little I pray you to the second branch of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond generall use tending to convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For I confesse that there is such a neare affinity between this let and that use, as that one may be said to embrace &amp; to re-imbrace the other, and that both agree in one, I meane in one end principally. For as there I did labour to make men see that they are out of Christ by the ill favour of their abominable thoughts, words and works to fit them for Christ, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101539:86"/> for the meanes to be used for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Christ, that they may see what need they have of Christ: so here I strive againe to make men sensible, if I can, of that same odious savour, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding them with their execrable basenesse, that <hi>I</hi> may take away that which letteth, after men have heard much of Christ, and know what they must doe to obtaine Christ, pressing them before and behinde, as fighting souldiers are wont to doe in the wars, to make some yeeld, who yet will stand it out and maintaine the field against Christ, supposing that they are for Christ, and Christs already, and need not goe to Christ, when indeed they are against Christ, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the odious sent of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hearts and lives, both to others, and to themselves, but to themselves especially.</p>
               <p>Brethren, this is my aime I tell you, and therefore I have purposely super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added this lot of Basenesse, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting my selfe what I had said in the former use of conviction, but intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101539:86"/> to second that by this, because I know that else all my preaching and my labour will be in vaine, if men be not made sensible of the most odious sent of their abominable deeds; and on the contrary, that if men doe once smell the intolerable stinch of their very dearest and most delicious sins, they will then labour as much as they can for that sweet <hi>rose of Sharon,</hi> Jesus Christ, to perfume and to sweeten their most corrupt and filthy hearts▪ For doe we not see how men will fetch roses, and other flowers and perfumes to perfume their roomes, if by reason of one that dyed of a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy disease, and stinks most abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, they cannot otherwise stay in their houses, as not being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the odious and pestilent sent wherewith the dead corps doth fill the same? and therefore I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably conclude, that if men were but or could be sensible of that infinitely more abominable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable smell, which that body of death, even sinne within their hearts

               <p>More particularly, that like a Rose he will purge out choler, and hatred, and lustfulnesse, and envie, and pride, and every other corruption, that you may be most troubled with, and that he will cleere your sight, that you may see your sinfulnesse more then you did, and take away your stonie hearts, that you may be able to mourn or to grieve more for your sinnes then you did, and that he will dissolve all stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages within you, and enlarge your hearts, that so you may run after him in the way of his commandements, and that he will be pleased to establish your hearts, and to pardon your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and to give rest unto your souls, and to take away all trembling from your hearts. Moreover, pray him with all humblenesse of minde, that he will not suffer your graces to decay, not to be so dead as sometimes you are, but rather will quicken your
